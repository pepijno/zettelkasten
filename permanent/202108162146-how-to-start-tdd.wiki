= How to start TDD =

Kent Beck told a great way on how to learn TDD. First write the implementation and tests like you normally would, then remove everything you have had and start with the test, and then do the implementation.
Keep in mind that with TDD you try to minimize the amount of tests you write [[../permanent/202108112346-tdd-minimize-tests.wiki]] and that your unit test should show what values are accepted [[../permanent/202108161053-unit-tests-should-show-what-is-covered.wiki]].
